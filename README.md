# ΜΥΕ046 – Computational Vision (Winter 2024–2025)
### Assignment Notebook

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **`assignment.ipynb`**, which is part of the course **ΜΥΕ046 – Computational Vision** (Winter Semester 2024–2025).  
The notebook includes a set of exercises worth **30% of the final grade**, combining theoretical questions and practical coding tasks in **Python**.

## 🧰 Requirements
The assignment uses the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (datasets, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier)
- scipy (truncnorm)
- torch (autograd, nn.parameter)
- tqdm (progress bars)

To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy torch tqdm
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-assignment.git
   cd vision-assignment
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions inside the notebook.
   - **Code cells**: Implement solutions for each task.
   - **Markdown cells**: Answer theoretical questions and provide explanations.

## 📌 Notes
- This assignment is **individual** — collaboration or use of AI-generated code is prohibited (per course rules).
- Make sure your code is **well-documented** and clear.
- Submit before the deadline: **Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 23:59**.
